This project aims to build a model using transfer learning. I used a pre trained Vision transformer to build a model which can be used to classify satellite images belonging to different terrains. By using transfer learning techniques, we can use the weights and biases of a pre trained transformer model and change the final classification layer based on the current requirement. And this helps us build a model that takes considerably less time to train, we utilize knowledge that the Vision transformer already possesses from training over the ImageNet dataset. We take considerably less time to train this model using transfer learning.
